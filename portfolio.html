<h2> Jodrell Bank Logo</h2>
    <p>As a student currently enrolled in Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, I am constantly met with different art assignments through a variety of mediums as per my curriculum.  My design classes have tasked me with different assignments that have pushed the way I have thought about shape, typography, and simplicity. <br><br> For one of my classes, I was assigned to create a new brand identity for the Jodrell Bank Observatory<br><br>
In doing so, I deconstructed how the world heritage site looked, and based my design from an aerial view of the structure, and based the colors on the time of day most tourists give the area a visit, which generally is daytime. Based on all the photos of the observatory,  I got experimental with my designs for the tourist spot. As you keep scrolling, I brand my logo through interchangeable mediums, such as envelopes, letterheads, invitations, websites, and even water bottles!</p>

    <h2> TEDx 2019: Darkroom</h2>
    <p>TEDx Rutgers is an organization that dedicates themselves to developing a conference to give people of different backgrounds a platform to send their message in the style of the infamous TED Talk conferences. For our conference this year, our theme was Darkroom. The idea of Darkroom is stemmed from the idea of how photographs were taken in history, and its process of being developed individually in dimly lit rooms known as darkrooms! <br><br>

Our focus this year with our speakers, was the question of what type of moment is worth capturing. In the spirit of Darkroom, I was tasked to design different logos and images that would be able to bring to life this theme of Darkroom while being adaptable to different parts of the conference.    </p>
