            <h2> Garden State Melodies </h2>
                
                <p>A SoundCloud artist named Aazar Khan commissioned me to design album art for “Garden State Melodies”, an collection of EDM/8-bit music that was an expression of the mountains of struggles he climbed through in his home state of New Jersey. In designing the album art, he wanted me to do something with a cracked record, so I made the crack on on the record the shape of New Jersey, and made the crack look like mountains, and the center of the record look like the sun shining past the two mountains.</p>

        <h2> Depths</h2>
        <!--this is th column stuff-->
        <p>Josh Doss, a musician, releasing his album “Depths” and was in need of album art. He came to me to really illustrate the heaviness and mysteries of world 10,000 leagues under the sea. I incorporated different types of sea animals such as vampire squid, minke whales,  siphonophores, and etc., alongside multiple forms of corals, to really liven up the sea floor. To top it off, I added a sea serpent in the shadows with red glowing eyes, to really heighten the deep mystery element my client was looking for.</p> <br>
